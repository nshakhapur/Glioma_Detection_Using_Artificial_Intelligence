## Introduction
Brain tumors present a significant challenge to patients and healthcare providers, impacting normal life due to their complex manifestations and treatment regimens. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have paved the way for more accurate and timely diagnosis of brain tumors, such as gliomas. This project aims to leverage machine learning algorithms to improve early detection and prognosis assessment, thereby enhancing patient outcomes.

## Project Overview
As the field of AI continues to evolve, it is imperative to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between healthcare professionals, data scientists, and technology developers. This project integrates clinical information and imaging studies to develop AI predictive models that analyze an array of symptoms, imaging features, and patient characteristics. These models generate personalized risk assessments and treatment recommendations, empowering clinicians to make more informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes a vast collection of clinical information and imaging studies. Details about the source and preprocessing steps are provided in the [Dataset](path_to_dataset) section.

## Methodology
Our approach involves the following steps:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Model Development
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Deployment and Integration

For detailed information, refer to the [Methodology](path_to_methodology) section.

## Results
In the evaluation of the given dataset, our AI Model showed a fairly good accuracy of approximately 81.24%. Although the accuracy of the model can be further improved, currently, it effectively handles a highly complex dataset consisting of 36 parameters and data from 8,256 patients.

## Usage
To use the AI model for glioma detection, follow the instructions in the [Usage](path_to_usage) section. Example commands and scripts are provided to help you get started.
